# Profile
- I still think authentication without having to give away truly private information would be awesome (i.e. anonymous). The real concern with these types of accounts is not that they're anonymous, it's that they might do shit that detracts from the chitchat experience without penalty. We could maybe come up with a financial penalty set up for these anon accounts in the case that they break conduct rules. Example: if you're an anon account you need to deposit money with us that we hold / slash away at if you are caught violating community rules

# Search
- At some point maybe somebody doesn't want to search, but instead "auto matched" with a provider (maybe you could get a discount for going this route / maybe it helps some new providers bootstrap and build a resume)

# Payment
- Profile page with a crypto QR code on it: could possibly create a tipping culture, there might be an equivalent of this that might be worth looking into for credit cards / debit cards
- This might be a stupid thought, but maybe even make the profile pic have a payment QR code embedded into it. At a weird mental level, at the most basic level it shows that the person themselves is a business unit
- At some point users could create blogs that are unlocked via micropayments. Text and images are lightweight and very easy adds. 
- You could bake a strong tipping culture everywhere into the application - tip for people's good reviews, tip people for providing quality service, etc. I say this because opening an application that you feel like you could make money on at any hour of the day could be insanely addicting

# Support 
- This might be stupider than fuck, but maybe there's a way to open source support within the marketplace. Need to think about this a bit more, but would be insanely cool if you didn't have to bring on a full time support staff and they were just independent contractors wandering around the marketplace seeking out to help users (similar to help within a hotel if that makes sense). Could maybe provide incentive by letting them get a cut on a certain user's transactions on chitchat, that way we don't directly have to pay nor do users

# Miscellaneous
- At the highest level, we need to build the correct incentives across all verticals of the platform: from seekers, to providers, to support, to outreach, etc. There's a ton of unique ways we could go about this and we need to keep spitting out weird thoughts
- With some money from penalties (and other ways we earn money) maybe there's a way we can create a "chitchat community fund" which helps incentivize people to do various types of work on the company's behalf to help it expand
